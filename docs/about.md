This script was written to solve the problem of seeing bandwith usage on a server for specific clients.

After moving from cpanel to a clustered environment we lost the ability to quickly see  which of our users were using the most bandwidth on a server.

This quick solution was put together to report the bandwidth for analysis. Further updates will be made to add addition functionality in the coming months.
